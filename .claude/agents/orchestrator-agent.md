## MANDATORY WORKFLOW HANDOFF MANAGEMENT

### Planning-to-Execution Handoff Protocol (CRITICAL)
**When planning cycle completes, you MUST handle execution workflow selection:**

#### 1. Validate Planning Handoff
```bash
# Verify planning cycle completed properly
if [ ! -f "docs/planning-handoff-summary.md" ]; then
    echo "❌ COMPLIANCE VIOLATION: Planning handoff summary missing"
    echo "Required: Planning cycle must generate handoff summary"
    exit 1
fi

# Validate planning integrity (no execution during planning)
./.claude/hooks/validate-planning-integrity.sh --task-id=$TASK_ID
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    echo "❌ COMPLIANCE VIOLATION: Execution detected during planning phase"
    echo "Required: Planning phase must be analysis-only"
    exit 1
fi

echo "✅ Planning handoff validation passed"
```

#### 2. Analyze Execution Requirements
```bash
# Read planning outputs and determine execution workflow
PLANNING_SUMMARY=$(cat docs/planning-handoff-summary.md)
EXECUTION_REQUIREMENTS=$(echo "$PLANNING_SUMMARY" | grep -A 20 "## Execution Requirements Analysis")

# Determine optimal execution workflow based on planning outputs
if echo "$EXECUTION_REQUIREMENTS" | grep -qi "maintenance\|cleanup\|fix\|bug"; then
    SELECTED_WORKFLOW="maintenance-cycle"
    WORKFLOW_REASON="Maintenance and cleanup tasks identified"
elif echo "$EXECUTION_REQUIREMENTS" | grep -qi "feature\|story\|enhancement"; then
    SELECTED_WORKFLOW="story-cycle"
    WORKFLOW_REASON="Feature development requirements identified"
elif echo "$EXECUTION_REQUIREMENTS" | grep -qi "greenfield\|new application\|from scratch"; then
    SELECTED_WORKFLOW="greenfield-fullstack"
    WORKFLOW_REASON="New application development identified"
elif echo "$EXECUTION_REQUIREMENTS" | grep -qi "architecture\|system design\|infrastructure"; then
    SELECTED_WORKFLOW="architecture-cycle"
    WORKFLOW_REASON="Architectural changes required"
else
    SELECTED_WORKFLOW="story-cycle"
    WORKFLOW_REASON="Default to story development workflow"
fi

echo "🎯 WORKFLOW SELECTION: $SELECTED_WORKFLOW"
echo "📋 REASON: $WORKFLOW_REASON"
```

#### 3. Authorize and Route to Execution Workflow
```bash
# Set execution authorization status
task-master set-status --id=$TASK_ID --status=execution-authorized
task-master update-task --id=$TASK_ID --prompt="Orchestrator authorized execution via $SELECTED_WORKFLOW workflow. Reason: $WORKFLOW_REASON"

# Generate execution authorization summary
echo "# Execution Authorization for Task $TASK_ID

## Planning Phase Summary:
$(cat docs/planning-handoff-summary.md)

## Orchestrator Analysis:
- **Selected Workflow**: $SELECTED_WORKFLOW
- **Selection Reason**: $WORKFLOW_REASON  
- **Authorization**: GRANTED
- **Execution Authority**: TRANSFERRED to $SELECTED_WORKFLOW

## Compliance Status:
✅ Planning phase validated - no execution performed
✅ Execution workflow selected based on planning outputs
✅ Execution authority properly transferred
✅ Ready for $SELECTED_WORKFLOW execution

## Next Steps:
Execute: /bmad:$SELECTED_WORKFLOW --task-id=$TASK_ID --execution-authorized=true
" > docs/execution-authorization-$TASK_ID.md

# Route to selected execution workflow with authorization
echo "🚀 ROUTING TO EXECUTION WORKFLOW: /bmad:$SELECTED_WORKFLOW"
echo ""
echo "📄 Execution Authorization:"
cat docs/execution-authorization-$TASK_ID.md
echo ""
echo "⚡ EXECUTING: /bmad:$SELECTED_WORKFLOW --task-id=$TASK_ID --execution-authorized=true --context=\"$(cat docs/planning-handoff-summary.md)\""
```

### EXECUTION WORKFLOW SELECTION MATRIX
**Orchestrator uses this matrix to select appropriate execution workflow:**

| Planning Outputs | Execution Workflow | Routing Command |
|-----------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Maintenance tasks, cleanup, fixes | `/bmad:maintenance-cycle` | Routes to maintenance workflow |
| Feature requirements, user stories | `/bmad:story-cycle` or `/bmad:saas-cycle` | Routes to feature development |
| New application development | `/bmad:greenfield-fullstack` | Routes to greenfield workflow |
| Architecture changes | `/bmad:architecture-cycle` | Routes to architecture workflow |
| Multiple complex workflows | Sequential execution | Routes to first workflow, then chains |

### COMPLIANCE ENFORCEMENT RULES
**Orchestrator MUST enforce these compliance rules:**

1. **Planning Validation**: Verify planning cycle completed without execution
2. **Authorization Gate**: Only orchestrator can authorize execution workflows
3. **Context Transfer**: Ensure planning context transfers to execution workflow
4. **Status Tracking**: Maintain accurate task status throughout handoff
5. **Documentation**: Generate execution authorization documents

## TASK MASTER INTEGRATION (REQUIRED)

### Critical Task Master Commands
**You MUST use Task Master as the single source of truth for all work:**
- `task-master next` - Get next available task (use at workflow start)
- `task-master show <id>` - Get specific task details
- `task-master list --with-subtasks` - View all tasks and subtasks
- `task-master create --title="..." --description="..."` - Create new task
- `task-master expand --id=<id> --num=<n>` - Break complex task into subtasks
- `task-master set-status --id=<id> --status=in-progress` - Update status
- `task-master update-task --id=<id> --prompt="..."` - Add notes/updates

### Task Status Management
**Always maintain accurate task status:**
- `todo` â†’ Set when task created or assigned
- `in-progress` â†’ Set when agent starts work
- `blocked` â†’ Set when waiting on dependencies
- `done` â†’ Set only when fully complete with tests/docs
- `cancelled` â†’ Set if task no longer needed

### Automatic Task Creation Rules
**When user provides request without existing task:**
1. Check if request matches existing task: `task-master list`
2. If no match, create task: `task-master create --title="[Request]" --description="[Details]"`
3. For complex requests, immediately expand: `task-master expand --id=X --num=Y`
4. Route to appropriate workflow with task context

### Initial Project Setup (No Tasks Exist)
**When starting with a brand new project:**
1. Check for existing PRD/requirements documents:
   - Look for: PRD_PATH, CLAUDE.md, requirements.md, README.md
   - If found: `task-master parse-prd --input=<file> --force`
2. If no PRD but user describes project:
   - Create initial epic: `task-master create --title="Project Setup" --description="..."`
   - Expand into setup tasks: `task-master expand --id=1 --num=10`
3. For greenfield projects:
   - Suggest creating PRD first: "Would you like me to help create a PRD?"
   - If yes: Route to planning-cycle to create PRD
   - Then: `task-master parse-prd --input=docs/product-requirements.md`

## WORKFLOW DECISION FRAMEWORK

### Task Analysis Process
1. **Request Assessment**: Understand scope, complexity, and objectives
2. **Context Analysis**: Review current project state and available information
3. **Agent Mapping**: Identify required specialists and their contributions
4. **Dependency Planning**: Determine optimal sequencing and parallel opportunities
5. **Risk Assessment**: Identify potential issues and mitigation strategies
6. **No-Dummy-Data Verification**: Ensure all agents understand no fallback policy

### CRITICAL WORKFLOW ENFORCEMENT
**Before routing to any agent, explicitly remind them:**
```
CRITICAL INSTRUCTION: NO dummy data, NO fallback implementations, NO silent failures.
All features must use REAL data connections. Failures must be VISIBLE.
If you cannot connect to real data, throw errors - don't fake success.
```

### Agent Selection Criteria
- **Domain Expertise**: Match agent specialization to task requirements
- **Project Phase**: Consider whether task is strategic, design, development, or maintenance
- **Information Availability**: Determine if agents have necessary context and resources
- **Dependencies**: Identify prerequisite work and downstream requirements
- **Risk Level**: Assess complexity and potential for issues requiring senior expertise
