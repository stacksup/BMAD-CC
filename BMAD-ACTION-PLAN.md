# BMAD-CC Enhancement Action Plan

## Quick Reference: What to Implement First

### ðŸŽ¯ Week 1: Quick Wins (18-26 hours)
*These will show immediate value with minimal effort*

#### 1. Advanced Elicitation Integration (8-12 hours)
**Files to modify:**
- `templates/.claude/agents/analyst-agent.md.tmpl`
- `templates/.claude/agents/pm-agent.md.tmpl`
- `templates/.claude/agents/architect-agent.md.tmpl`
- `templates/.claude/agents/ux-agent.md.tmpl`

**Add after each template section:**
```markdown
## Interactive Refinement
Choose an elicitation method to enhance this section:
0. Expand for specific audience
1. Critique and refine
2. Identify risks and mitigations
3. Apply Tree of Thoughts analysis
4. Use ReWOO reasoning
5. Apply Meta-Prompting
6. Red Team vs Blue Team analysis
7. Performance optimization analysis
8. Alternative approaches exploration
9. Proceed to next section

[Wait for user selection 0-9, then apply chosen method]
```

#### 2. Document Sharding System (6-8 hours)
**Files to modify:**
- `templates/.claude/agents/po-agent.md.tmpl`

**Add capability:**
```markdown
## SHARD-DOC CAPABILITY
When large documents need development consumption:
1. Check for automated tool: `md-tree explode {input} {output}`
2. Manual fallback: Split by ## headings
3. Create index: docs/{doc-name}/index.md
4. Link sections for focused development
```

#### 3. AI Frontend Generation (4-6 hours)
**Files to modify:**
- `templates/.claude/agents/ux-agent.md.tmpl`

**Add capability:**
```markdown
## AI FRONTEND PROMPT GENERATION
After UX specification completion:
1. Extract key UI components and requirements
2. Generate optimized prompt for v0/Lovable:
   - Component structure
   - Styling requirements
   - Interaction patterns
   - Mobile responsiveness
3. Include integration requirements from architecture
```

### ðŸ“‹ Week 2-3: Core Quality (22-30 hours)

#### 4. Story Validation Pipeline (12-16 hours)
**Enhance SM Agent:**
- Add systematic story creation with anti-hallucination
- Reference architecture documents for technical accuracy
- Include implementation readiness assessment

**Enhance PO Agent:**
- Add validate-next-story capability
- Use story-draft-checklist for scoring
- Enforce minimum 7/10 validation score

#### 5. Validation Gate Automation (10-14 hours)
**Hook Integration:**
- Update `templates/.claude/hooks/on-posttooluse.ps1.tmpl`
- Integrate `validation-enforcer.ps1.tmpl` with workflows
- Add validation triggers to cycle commands

---

### ðŸš€ Week 4: Strategic Capabilities (24-36 hours)

#### 6. Brownfield Documentation (16-24 hours)
**Enhance Architect Agent:**
- Add document-project capability
- Systematic codebase analysis
- Technical debt documentation
- Integration point mapping

#### 7. Change Management (8-12 hours)
**Cross-Agent Enhancement:**
- Add correct-course capability
- Impact analysis templates
- Sprint change proposals
- Rollback procedures

## Testing Strategy

### For Each Enhancement:
1. **Unit Test**: Individual agent capability
2. **Integration Test**: Full workflow with enhancement
3. **Quality Test**: Measure improvement metrics
4. **User Test**: Gather feedback on experience

### Rollback Plan:
- Keep original templates backed up
- Test in isolated project first
- Gradual rollout to production projects
- Monitor for issues and adjust

---

## Resource Requirements

### Developer Time:
- **Total**: 64-92 hours over 4 weeks
- **Weekly**: 16-23 hours
- **Daily**: 3-5 hours

### Testing Time:
- **Per enhancement**: 2-4 hours
- **Total testing**: 14-28 hours

### Documentation:
- **Update CHANGELOG.md** after each enhancement
- **Update README.md** with new capabilities
- **Create examples** for each new feature

---

## Risk Mitigation

### Potential Risks:
1. **Breaking existing workflows**
   - Mitigation: Thorough testing, gradual rollout
2. **User confusion with new features**
   - Mitigation: Clear documentation, examples
3. **Performance impact**
   - Mitigation: Monitor execution times, optimize
4. **Integration conflicts**
   - Mitigation: Careful dependency management
