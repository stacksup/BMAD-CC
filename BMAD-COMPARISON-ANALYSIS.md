# BMAD Framework Comprehensive Comparison Analysis

## Executive Summary

After conducting a 6-pass deep analysis of the BMAD-CC framework, comparing it against the original BMAD methodology references, I've identified both significant achievements and critical gaps. The framework successfully transforms BMAD into a Claude Code-native system with sophisticated agent orchestration, but lacks several core capabilities that would realize its full potential.
