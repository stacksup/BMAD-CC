## 🔍 What You Can Test Now

### Test Automated Validation:
```bash
# Create a story document with missing sections
echo "# Incomplete Story\nUser Story: Missing acceptance criteria" > docs/stories/test-story.md

# Run story cycle - validation will automatically detect issues
/bmad:story-cycle

# You should see:
# "🔍 Running automated validation for story-draft..."
# "❌ VALIDATION FAILED: story-draft score 2/10 is below minimum 7/10"
# "Please address validation issues in: story-draft-test.md"
```

### Test Change Detection:
```bash
# Modify PRD with scope change indicators
echo "TODO: Add new requirement for mobile app" >> docs/PRD.md

# Run smart cycle - change detection will trigger
/bmad:smart-cycle

# You should see:
# "🔍 Checking for pending changes..."
# "📊 Scope change detected in: docs/PRD.md"
# "🔄 Change request created: CR-PROJECT-20250811-1430"
# "⚠️ Pending change: CR-PROJECT-20250811-1430 requires validation"
```

### Test Quality Gate Enforcement:
```bash
# Try to proceed with invalid documentation
# Quality gates will block progression until validation passes

/bmad:planning-cycle
# Will check all planning documents and enforce quality gates
# "🔍 Enforcing Planning Phase Quality Gates..."
# Either passes with validation or blocks with specific issues
```

## 🎯 How Phase 3 Automation Works

### Validation Automation Flow:
1. **Workflow triggers validation** at key checkpoints
2. **Hook checks for existing reports** in docs/validation/
3. **If no report exists**, runs automated validation with scoring
4. **Enforces minimum scores** (configurable per validation type)
5. **Blocks progression** if quality gates not met
6. **Provides specific guidance** on what needs fixing

### Change Management Flow:
1. **Change detector monitors** file modifications and content
2. **Automatically creates change requests** when scope changes detected
3. **Routes to Product Owner** for impact assessment
4. **Enforces change validation** before allowing workflow progression
5. **Provides rollback planning** and stakeholder communication
6. **Archives approved changes** with lessons learned

### Quality Gate Integration:
```bash
# Environment variables automatically set by workflows:
BMAD_STORY_MIN_SCORE=7          # Story validation minimum
BMAD_DOD_MIN_SCORE=9            # Definition of Done minimum  
BMAD_ARCH_MIN_SCORE=8           # Architecture validation minimum
BMAD_CHANGE_MIN_SCORE=7         # Change impact minimum

# Quality gates can be temporarily disabled:
BMAD_DISABLE_GATES=1            # Emergency override (not recommended)
```
