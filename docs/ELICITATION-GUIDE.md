## Brainstorming Techniques

### Creative Expansion Methods

#### 1. What If Scenarios
**Purpose**: Explore alternative realities and constraints  
**How to Use**: Ask provocative questions sequentially  
**Example**: 
- "What if we had unlimited budget?"
- "What if we had only 1 week?"
- "What if mobile was the only platform?"

**Best For**: Breaking mental constraints, finding creative solutions

#### 2. Analogical Thinking
**Purpose**: Find patterns from other domains  
**How to Use**: Start with one analogy, find 2-3 more  
**Example**: 
- "This is like Uber for healthcare"
- "Think of it as Netflix for education"
- "It's Instagram meets LinkedIn"

**Best For**: Explaining complex concepts, finding proven patterns

#### 3. Reversal/Inversion
**Purpose**: Learn by exploring opposites  
**How to Use**: Ask the reverse question  
**Example**: 
- "How would we make this fail?"
- "What would the worst solution look like?"
- "How could we make users hate this?"

**Best For**: Identifying risks, finding critical success factors

#### 4. First Principles Thinking
**Purpose**: Strip away assumptions to core truths  
**How to Use**: Break down to fundamentals  
**Example**: 
- "What are the physics of this problem?"
- "What absolutely must be true?"
- "What can't be changed?"

**Best For**: Complex problems, innovative solutions

### Structured Frameworks

#### 5. SCAMPER Method
**Purpose**: Systematic feature exploration  
**Process**: Go through each letter sequentially

- **S**ubstitute: What can we replace?
- **C**ombine: What can we merge?
- **A**dapt: What can we adjust?
- **M**odify/Magnify: What can we emphasize?
- **P**ut to other use: Alternative applications?
- **E**liminate: What can we remove?
- **R**everse: What can we invert?

**Best For**: Feature development, product improvement

#### 6. Six Thinking Hats
**Purpose**: Explore from multiple perspectives  
**Process**: Wear one "hat" at a time

- **White Hat** (Facts): What do we know?
- **Red Hat** (Emotions): How do we feel?
- **Black Hat** (Caution): What could go wrong?
- **Yellow Hat** (Optimism): What's the best case?
- **Green Hat** (Creativity): What's new?
- **Blue Hat** (Process): How do we proceed?

**Best For**: Team decisions, comprehensive analysis

#### 7. Mind Mapping
**Purpose**: Visual idea exploration  
**Process**: Start central, branch outward  
**Structure**:
```
        Feature A
       /
Core Idea --- Feature B --- Sub-feature 1
       \                \--- Sub-feature 2
        Feature C
```

**Best For**: Complex systems, feature relationships

### Collaborative Techniques

#### 8. "Yes, And..." Building
**Purpose**: Build momentum through acceptance  
**Process**: Each idea builds on the previous  
**Example**:
- A: "We could add user profiles"
- B: "Yes, and they could be customizable"
- A: "Yes, and include achievement badges"

**Best For**: Team brainstorming, positive energy

#### 9. Brainwriting/Round Robin
**Purpose**: Equal contribution from all  
**Process**: Write ideas, pass, build on others  
**Benefits**: Introverts contribute equally

**Best For**: Diverse teams, avoiding dominance

#### 10. Random Stimulation
**Purpose**: Force unexpected connections  
**Process**: Random word/image triggers ideas  
**Example**: 
- Random word: "Pizza"
- Connection: "Delivery in 30 minutes feature"

**Best For**: Breaking mental blocks, fresh perspectives

### Deep Exploration

#### 11. Five Whys
**Purpose**: Find root causes  
**Process**: Ask "why" five times  
**Example**:
1. Why do users abandon carts? → Shipping costs
2. Why are shipping costs high? → No bulk rates
3. Why no bulk rates? → Low volume
4. Why low volume? → Limited marketing
5. Why limited marketing? → Budget constraints

**Best For**: Problem solving, root cause analysis

#### 12. Morphological Analysis
**Purpose**: Explore all combinations  
**Process**: Matrix of parameters and options

| Parameter | Option 1 | Option 2 | Option 3 |
|-----------|----------|----------|----------|
| Platform | Web | Mobile | Desktop |
| Payment | One-time | Subscription | Freemium |
| Users | B2C | B2B | B2B2C |

**Best For**: Product variations, comprehensive coverage

#### 13. Provocation Technique (PO)
**Purpose**: Extract value from absurd ideas  
**Process**: Make provocative statement, find utility  
**Example**: 
- PO: "Users never read documentation"
- Insight: "Build self-explanatory UI"

**Best For**: Breaking assumptions, innovative thinking

### Advanced Techniques

#### 14. Forced Relationships
**Purpose**: Connect unrelated concepts  
**Process**: Find bridges between random items  
**Example**: "Piano + Authentication = Musical password"

**Best For**: Innovation, unique solutions

#### 15. Assumption Reversal
**Purpose**: Challenge core beliefs  
**Process**: List assumptions, reverse each  
**Example**: 
- Assumption: "Users want more features"
- Reversal: "Users want fewer, better features"

**Best For**: Paradigm shifts, disruption

#### 16. Role Playing
**Purpose**: Understand different perspectives  
**Process**: Think as different stakeholders  
**Perspectives**: CEO, End User, Developer, Competitor

**Best For**: Empathy, comprehensive requirements

#### 17. Time Shifting
**Purpose**: Learn from different eras  
**Questions**: 
- "How would we solve this in 1995?"
- "How will this work in 2030?"

**Best For**: Technology choices, future-proofing

#### 18. Resource Constraints
**Purpose**: Force efficiency  
**Constraints**: 
- "$10 and 1 hour"
- "No internet connection"
- "One developer, one week"

**Best For**: MVP definition, creative solutions

#### 19. Metaphor Mapping
**Purpose**: Understand through analogy  
**Process**: Extended metaphor exploration  
**Example**: "If our system were a restaurant..."
- Frontend = Dining room
- Backend = Kitchen
- API = Waiters
- Database = Pantry

**Best For**: System understanding, communication

#### 20. Question Storming
**Purpose**: Understand before solving  
**Process**: Generate questions, not answers  
**Output**: 50+ questions about the problem

**Best For**: Problem definition, discovery phase
