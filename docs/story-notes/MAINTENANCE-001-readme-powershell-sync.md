# Story: MAINTENANCE-001 - README PowerShell References Sync Issue

## Overview
Resolved git synchronization issue where README.md PowerShell references had been correctly updated locally to bash references but were not pushed to GitHub, creating documentation inconsistency.

## Context
- **Task ID**: MAINTENANCE-001
- **Task Type**: Maintenance Cycle
- **Date Completed**: 2025-08-16
- **Developer(s)**: Diana (Documentation Manager)
- **Change Type**: Chore (Git synchronization/deployment issue)

## Requirements
- Investigate reported README PowerShell references issue
- Ensure documentation accuracy between local and remote repositories
- Resolve any missing fixes or synchronization problems

## Investigation Findings

### Root Cause Analysis
- **Issue Type**: Git synchronization issue, NOT missing code fixes
- **Status**: README.md has been correctly updated locally to use bash scripts
- **Problem**: Changes haven't been pushed to GitHub yet
- **Impact**: Documentation appears outdated on remote repository

### Local Documentation Status
- README.md contains proper bash script references:
  - Line 27: `curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stacksup/BMAD-CC/main/bootstrap.sh | bash -s -- --project-dir . --project-type auto`
  - Line 33: `./simple-install.sh --project-dir /path/to/your/project`
- All PowerShell references correctly converted to bash equivalents
- Documentation is consistent with the PowerShell to bash migration (Tasks #11 and #12)

### Verification Results
- ✅ README.md locally updated with bash references
- ✅ Documentation matches current infrastructure (bash-based)
- ✅ No missing code fixes identified
- ⚠️ Changes need to be pushed to GitHub for public visibility

## Resolution
- **Action Taken**: Documented current state and confirmed no code fixes needed
- **Finding**: This is a deployment/synchronization issue, not a development issue
- **Next Steps**: Push existing correct documentation to GitHub
- **Status**: Documentation is accurate, just needs git push operation

## Key Files Verified
- `/mnt/c/Users/cstac/AI-Projects/BMAD-CC/README.md` - Contains correct bash script references
- Bootstrap and installation commands properly reference `.sh` files
- No PowerShell references remain in documentation

## Lessons Learned
- Maintenance tasks can be git synchronization issues rather than code fixes
- Always verify local vs remote documentation consistency
- Document deployment steps as part of maintenance workflow
- Git status should be checked as part of maintenance investigation

## Follow-up Items
- [ ] Push README.md changes to GitHub repository
- [ ] Verify remote documentation matches local state
- [ ] Consider adding git sync checks to maintenance workflow
- [ ] Update maintenance cycle to include deployment verification
