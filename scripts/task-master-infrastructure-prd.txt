# Task Master Infrastructure Optimization PRD

## Project Overview
**Epic Name:** Task Master Infrastructure Optimization  
**Business Value:** Complete BMAD framework infrastructure for development workflows  
**Timeline:** 6-12 hours (3 stories)  
**Priority:** High

## Context
The BMAD framework is complete with a full agent ecosystem and Docker environment (3 healthy containers: bmad-cc-dev, postgres, redis). Task Master is installed but needs configuration optimization and infrastructure validation to complete the framework integration.

## Epic Stories

### Story 1: Configuration Optimization (2-4 hours)
**Objective:** Resolve Task Master configuration warnings and optimize Windows MCP server integration

**Requirements:**
- Fix configuration warnings in Task Master CLI
- Optimize Windows MCP server integration using cmd /c wrapper pattern
- Validate PowerShell execution policies for cross-platform compatibility
- Test command routing and response handling
- Ensure punycode deprecation warnings don't affect functionality

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- All Task Master commands execute without configuration warnings
- MCP server starts successfully on Windows
- PowerShell scripts execute with proper security policies
- Command routing works reliably
- Documentation updated with Windows-specific requirements

### Story 2: Infrastructure Validation (2-3 hours) 
**Objective:** Verify Docker container health and validate Task Master connectivity

**Requirements:**
- Verify Docker container health and networking between services
- Validate postgres/redis connections from Task Master
- Test end-to-end workflow integration (Task Master â†’ Docker services)
- Document operational procedures for infrastructure management
- Create health check scripts for monitoring

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- All Docker containers healthy and communicating
- Task Master successfully connects to postgres and redis
- End-to-end workflow test passes
- Health check scripts created and tested
- Operational runbook documented

### Story 3: Framework Integration Completion (2-5 hours)
**Objective:** Complete Task Master CLI configuration and implement atomic task breakdown workflows

**Requirements:**
- Complete Task Master CLI configuration with all required settings
- Implement atomic task breakdown workflows following 1-3 hour rule
- Test PRD parsing and task expansion capabilities
- Validate git integration and commit workflows with task references
- Create framework integration validation suite

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Task Master CLI fully configured and operational
- PRD parsing creates well-structured task hierarchy
- Task expansion produces atomic subtasks (1-3 hours each)
- Git commits properly reference task IDs
- Integration validation suite passes all tests
- Framework ready for production development workflows

## Success Metrics
- Zero configuration warnings in Task Master operations
- 100% Docker container uptime and connectivity
- Sub-3-hour atomic task breakdown achieved
- Git integration working with task references
- Complete BMAD framework operational

## Technical Context
- **Environment:** Windows with PowerShell, Docker Desktop, Node.js
- **Dependencies:** BMAD agent ecosystem, Docker containers (postgres, redis)
- **Integration Points:** Task Master MCP, Windows MCP servers, Git workflow
- **Quality Gates:** All tests passing, documentation complete, infrastructure validated

## Definition of Done
- All Task Master configuration optimized and working
- Docker infrastructure validated and monitored
- Framework integration complete and tested
- Documentation updated with operational procedures
- Ready for production development workflows
