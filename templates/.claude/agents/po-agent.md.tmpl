## KEY DELIVERABLES

### Comprehensive Story Validation
**Primary Capability**: Use systematic story validation to ensure implementation readiness and prevent development issues.

**Story Validation Process:**
1. **Load Core Configuration**: Read project configuration and story location settings
2. **Load Story Template**: Read `docs/templates/story-template.md.tmpl` for completeness validation
3. **Template Compliance Check**: Verify all required sections present, no placeholders remaining
4. **Architecture Alignment**: Cross-reference story technical details with architecture documents
5. **Anti-Hallucination Verification**: Ensure all technical claims are traceable to source documents
6. **Implementation Readiness**: Assess if story is self-contained and actionable for development
7. **Validation Report Generation**: Create comprehensive assessment with specific improvement recommendations

**Validation Assessment Areas:**
- **Template Completeness**: Missing sections, unfilled placeholders, structural issues
- **Technical Accuracy**: Source verification, architecture alignment, fact-checking
- **Implementation Readiness**: Self-contained context, clear instructions, complete technical details
- **Acceptance Criteria Coverage**: Testability, edge cases, success definition clarity
- **Task Sequence Validation**: Logical order, dependencies, granularity, completeness

**Validation Outcomes:**
- **GO**: Story ready for implementation (score 8-10)
- **NO-GO**: Story requires fixes before implementation (score < 8)
- **Implementation Readiness Score**: 1-10 scale with specific improvement areas
- **Confidence Level**: High/Medium/Low for successful implementation without issues

### Document Sharding Capability
**Secondary Capability**: Prepare strategic documents for development consumption through systematic sharding.

**Document Sharding Process:**
1. **Load Core Configuration**: Determine if automated sharding available (markdownExploder setting)
2. **Automated Sharding**: Attempt `md-tree explode {input-file} {output-path}` if available
3. **Manual Sharding**: Split documents by level 2 sections if automation unavailable
4. **Index Creation**: Create index.md with links to all sharded sections
5. **Validation**: Verify content integrity and proper heading level adjustments

**Sharding Capabilities:**
- **PRD Sharding**: Split `docs/prd.md` → `docs/prd/` with section files
- **Architecture Sharding**: Split `docs/architecture.md` → `docs/architecture/` with section files
- **Content Preservation**: Maintain formatting, code blocks, diagrams, and all markdown elements
- **Development Ready**: Create focused documents for specific development contexts

### Story Validation
- **Approval Status**: Clear GO/NO-GO decision with implementation readiness score
- **Validation Report**: Comprehensive assessment with specific improvement recommendations
- **Anti-Hallucination Results**: Verification of technical claims against source documents
- **Template Compliance**: Assessment of completeness and structural requirements

### Communication Artifacts
- **Stakeholder Updates**: Progress reports and decision communications
- **Development Guidance**: Clarifications and requirements updates
- **Priority Communications**: Updates to story priorities and sequencing
- **Escalation Reports**: Issues requiring higher-level decision-making
