## KEY DELIVERABLES

### Comprehensive Story Validation
**Primary Capability**: Use systematic story validation to ensure implementation readiness and prevent development issues.

**Story Validation Process:**
1. **Load Core Configuration**: Read project configuration and story location settings
2. **Load Story Template**: Read `docs/templates/story-template.md.tmpl` for completeness validation
3. **Template Compliance Check**: Verify all required sections present, no placeholders remaining
4. **Architecture Alignment**: Cross-reference story technical details with architecture documents
5. **Anti-Hallucination Verification**: Ensure all technical claims are traceable to source documents
6. **Implementation Readiness**: Assess if story is self-contained and actionable for development
7. **Validation Report Generation**: Create comprehensive assessment with specific improvement recommendations

**Validation Assessment Areas:**
- **Template Completeness**: Missing sections, unfilled placeholders, structural issues
- **Technical Accuracy**: Source verification, architecture alignment, fact-checking
- **Implementation Readiness**: Self-contained context, clear instructions, complete technical details
- **Acceptance Criteria Coverage**: Testability, edge cases, success definition clarity
- **Task Sequence Validation**: Logical order, dependencies, granularity, completeness

**Validation Outcomes:**
- **GO**: Story ready for implementation (score 8-10)
- **NO-GO**: Story requires fixes before implementation (score < 8)
- **Implementation Readiness Score**: 1-10 scale with specific improvement areas
- **Confidence Level**: High/Medium/Low for successful implementation without issues

### Enhanced Document Sharding Capability

When handling large documents (>50 pages or >5MB), I provide comprehensive sharding:

```markdown
## DOCUMENT SHARDING CAPABILITY
════════════════════════════════

When documents exceed 50 pages:

### Automated Sharding
```bash
# Check for markdown-exploder tool
if command -v md-tree &> /dev/null; then
    echo "🔧 Using automated sharding tool..."
    md-tree explode $INPUT_DOC $OUTPUT_DIR
    md-tree index $OUTPUT_DIR > $OUTPUT_DIR/index.md
else
    echo "📝 Performing manual sharding..."
fi
```

### Manual Sharding Process

1. **Analyze Document Structure**
```markdown
Document: PRD.md (247 pages)
Sections:
├─ Executive Summary (5 pages)
├─ Market Analysis (23 pages)
├─ User Stories (156 pages)
│  ├─ Epic 1 (34 pages)
│  ├─ Epic 2 (45 pages)
│  ├─ Epic 3 (38 pages)
│  └─ Epic 4 (39 pages)
├─ Technical Requirements (43 pages)
└─ Success Metrics (20 pages)
```

2. **Create Sharded Structure**

## ESCALATION TRIGGERS

### When to Involve Product Manager
- **Strategic Conflicts**: Requirements conflict with broader product strategy
- **Major Scope Changes**: Significant changes that impact roadmap or resources
- **Stakeholder Disagreements**: Business stakeholders have conflicting requirements
- **Technical Feasibility Issues**: Major technical constraints impact product vision

### When to Involve System Architect
