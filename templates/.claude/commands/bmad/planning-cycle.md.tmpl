## STRATEGIC PLANNING WORKFLOW

This workflow coordinates strategic agents to create comprehensive project plans before development begins. Use when requirements are unclear, architectural planning is needed, or business validation is required.

## VIBE CEO PHILOSOPHY

As the **Vibe CEO**, you are directing a team of specialized AI agents through strategic planning. Your role:
- **Vision**: Provide clear strategic direction and objectives
- **Refinement**: Challenge outputs and iterate for quality
- **Oversight**: Maintain alignment across all planning phases
- **Decision**: Make key strategic choices when agents present options

Remember: You think like a CEO with unlimited resources. Push agents to deliver their best work.

## 0) MANDATORY: EXECUTION AUTHORIZATION VALIDATION

**COMPLIANCE ENFORCEMENT: Validate execution authority before proceeding**
```bash
# CRITICAL: Validate this workflow has execution authorization
TASK_ID=${1:-$({{TASKMASTER_CLI}} current-task-id 2>/dev/null)}
EXECUTION_AUTHORIZED=${2:-false}

if [ "$EXECUTION_AUTHORIZED" != "true" ]; then
    echo "❌ COMPLIANCE VIOLATION: Planning cycle requires execution authorization"
    echo "Required: Must be routed from orchestrator with --execution-authorized=true"
    echo ""
    echo "Proper usage: /bmad:planning-cycle --task-id=<id> --execution-authorized=true"
    echo ""
    echo "If this is a direct planning request:"
    echo "1. Create task: {{TASKMASTER_CLI}} create --title='Planning: [description]'"
    echo "2. Route through orchestrator for authorization"
    exit 1
fi

# Validate task exists and is properly tracked
if [ -z "$TASK_ID" ]; then
    echo "❌ COMPLIANCE VIOLATION: Task ID required for planning workflow"
    echo "Required: All planning work must be tracked in Task Master"
    exit 1
fi

# Verify task status allows execution
TASK_STATUS=$({{TASKMASTER_CLI}} get-status --id=$TASK_ID 2>/dev/null)
if [[ "$TASK_STATUS" != "execution-authorized" && "$TASK_STATUS" != "in-progress" ]]; then
    echo "❌ COMPLIANCE VIOLATION: Task $TASK_ID not authorized for execution"
    echo "Current status: $TASK_STATUS"
    echo "Required status: execution-authorized or in-progress"
    exit 1
fi

# Set task status to in-progress
{{TASKMASTER_CLI}} set-status --id=$TASK_ID --status=in-progress

echo "✅ Execution authorization validated for planning cycle"
echo "📋 Task ID: $TASK_ID"
echo "🔧 Planning workflow authorized to proceed"
```

**Task Master Integration (MANDATORY):**
```bash
# Initialize or update task tracking
if [ -n "$TASK_ID" ]; then
    # Update existing task
    {{TASKMASTER_CLI}} update-task --id=$TASK_ID --prompt="Planning cycle started - execution authorized"
else
    # Create new planning task if none provided
    TASK_ID=$({{TASKMASTER_CLI}} create --title="Planning: [Auto-generated]" --type="planning" --status="in-progress")
    echo "📝 Created planning task: $TASK_ID"
fi

# Set planning-specific metadata
{{TASKMASTER_CLI}} set-field --id=$TASK_ID --field="workflow" --value="planning-cycle"
{{TASKMASTER_CLI}} set-field --id=$TASK_ID --field="execution-start" --value="$(date -Iseconds)"
```

fi

# If docker-compose.yml exists, validate it
if [ -f "{{DOCKER_COMPOSE_FILE}}" ] || [ -f "docker-compose.yml" ]; then
    docker-compose config > /dev/null 2>&1
    if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
        echo "✅ Docker compose configuration valid"
    else
        echo "⚠️ Docker compose configuration has errors - will need fixing during planning"
    fi
fi
```

### 0B) Task Master Integration
**Initialize task tracking for planning outputs:**
```bash
# Ensure Task Master is available
{{TASKMASTER_CLI}} --version > /dev/null 2>&1
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    echo "❌ Task Master required for planning workflow"
    exit 1
fi

# Create planning epic if not exists

- **Stakeholder Disagreement**: Business objectives not aligned

### Exception Workflows
- **Scope Reduction**: Reduce project scope to fit constraints
- **Timeline Extension**: Extend timeline to accommodate requirements
- **Resource Addition**: Add resources to meet timeline and scope
- **Strategic Pivot**: Modify product strategy based on technical constraints

## USAGE EXAMPLES

```
User: "We want to build a project management tool for remote teams"
Planning Outcome: 
- Market analysis of PM tools and remote work trends
- Product strategy for competitive differentiation
- SaaS architecture with real-time collaboration
- UX design for distributed team workflows
Transition: → `/bmad:greenfield-fullstack`
```

### Example 2: Mobile App Addition
```
User: "Add mobile app support to our existing web application"
Planning Outcome:
- Analysis of mobile user needs vs web functionality
- Mobile-first product strategy and feature prioritization
- API architecture for mobile client support
- Mobile UX design optimized for touch interfaces
Transition: → `/bmad:brownfield-enhancement` + mobile development
```

Remember: Strategic planning prevents costly rework and ensures development efforts align with business objectives. Invest time in planning to accelerate development and improve outcomes.
