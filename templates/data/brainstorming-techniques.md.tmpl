# Brainstorming Techniques for {{PROJECT_NAME}}

## Creative Expansion Techniques

### 1. What If Scenarios
- Ask one provocative question, get their response, then ask another
- Example: "What if we had unlimited budget?" → "What if we had only 1 week?"

### 2. Analogical Thinking
- Give one example analogy, ask them to find 2-3 more
- Example: "This is like Uber for X" → Find similar patterns

### 3. Reversal/Inversion
- Pose the reverse question, let them work through it
- Example: "How would we make this fail?" → Learn what to avoid

### 4. First Principles Thinking
- Ask "What are the fundamentals?" and guide them to break it down
- Strip away assumptions to core truths

## Structured Frameworks

### 5. SCAMPER Method
- Go through one letter at a time, wait for their ideas before moving to next
- **S**ubstitute, **C**ombine, **A**dapt, **M**odify, **P**ut to another use, **E**liminate, **R**everse

### 6. Six Thinking Hats
- Present one hat, ask for their thoughts, then move to next hat
- White (facts), Red (emotions), Black (caution), Yellow (optimism), Green (creativity), Blue (process)

### 7. Mind Mapping
- Start with central concept, ask them to suggest branches
- Build visual connections between related ideas

## Collaborative Techniques

### 8. "Yes, And..." Building
- They give idea, you "yes and" it, they "yes and" back - alternate
- Build momentum through positive reinforcement

### 9. Brainwriting/Round Robin
- They suggest idea, you build on it, ask them to build on yours
- Create iterative improvement cycles

### 10. Random Stimulation
- Give one random prompt/word, ask them to make connections
- Force unexpected associations

## Deep Exploration

### 11. Five Whys
- Ask "why" and wait for their answer before asking next "why"
- Drill down to root causes

### 12. Morphological Analysis
- Ask them to list parameters first, then explore combinations together
- Create matrix of possibilities

### 13. Provocation Technique (PO)
- Give one provocative statement, ask them to extract useful ideas
- Example: "PO: Users never read documentation"

## Advanced Techniques

### 14. Forced Relationships
- Connect two unrelated concepts and ask them to find the bridge
- Example: "How does a piano relate to user authentication?"

### 15. Assumption Reversal
- Challenge their core assumptions and ask them to build from there
- "What if the opposite were true?"

### 16. Role Playing
- Ask them to brainstorm from different stakeholder perspectives
- CEO view vs. End user view vs. Developer view

### 17. Time Shifting
- "How would you solve this in 1995? 2030?"
- Learn from constraints and possibilities of different eras

### 18. Resource Constraints
- "What if you had only $10 and 1 hour?"
- Force creative solutions through limitations

### 19. Metaphor Mapping
- Use extended metaphors to explore solutions
- "If this system were a restaurant, what would each component be?"

### 20. Question Storming
- Generate questions instead of answers first
- Understand the problem space before solving

## Application in {{PROJECT_TYPE}} Projects

{{#if PROJECT_TYPE.saas}}
### SaaS-Specific Applications
- **Multi-tenant considerations**: Use Role Playing for different tenant perspectives
- **Scaling challenges**: Apply Resource Constraints to find efficient solutions
- **Feature prioritization**: Innovation Tournament between feature sets
{{/if}}

{{#if PROJECT_TYPE.phaser}}
### Game Development Applications
- **Game mechanics**: SCAMPER method for innovative gameplay
- **Player engagement**: "Yes, And..." for feature expansion
- **Level design**: Morphological Analysis for variety
{{/if}}

{{#if PROJECT_TYPE.mobile}}
### Mobile Development Applications
- **Platform differences**: Six Thinking Hats for iOS vs Android decisions
- **Offline capabilities**: What If Scenarios for connectivity states
- **Performance**: Resource Constraints for battery/memory optimization
{{/if}}

## Integration with BMAD Workflow

### During Planning Phase
- Use with PM agent for feature ideation
- Apply with Architect for system design alternatives
- Leverage with UX Expert for interface innovations

### During Development
- Problem-solving with Dev agent
- Test scenario generation with QA agent
- Process improvement with Scrum Master

### Key Principles
1. **One technique at a time** - Don't overwhelm with multiple methods
2. **Interactive process** - Wait for responses before proceeding
3. **Build on ideas** - Each technique should enhance previous insights
4. **Document outcomes** - Capture all generated ideas for later review
