# Test Lesson Creation

This is a test scenario to validate that the lessons learned system is properly integrated.

## Story Notes
During implementation of authentication system, we encountered several challenges:
- JWT token storage security issues
- Session management complexity
- API integration problems

## Implementation Challenges
1. **Security Issue**: Initially stored JWT tokens in localStorage which exposed them to XSS attacks
2. **Performance Problem**: Session validation was hitting database on every request
3. **Integration Challenge**: Frontend-backend token synchronization issues

## Solutions Applied
- Moved to httpOnly cookies for token storage
- Implemented token refresh mechanism
- Added proper CORS configuration

## Lessons to Extract
This story provides clear opportunities for lesson extraction:
- Authentication implementation patterns (project-implementation)
- Security best practices (technology-patterns)  
- Token management troubleshooting (troubleshooting)

## Expected Outputs
The learnings-agent should be able to extract lessons from these story notes and create structured lesson documents.
